1.Add element to an array

Question:
Write a program to insert an element into an array to the nth position without using any inbuilt functions.

Working:
The program creates a function that takes an array as argument.The function takes the position and element
from the user.Then the element is added to the given position and the other elements is not removed or deleted.
The elements are added to the right to the new element.

2.Print primenumber betweeen an interval

Question: 
Write a program to display prime numbers between 2 intervals without using any inbuilt functions

Working:
The program creats a function that takes the interval as arguments.In the function,numbers is checked whether the number is divisible using 2 loops.
If the number is divisible, a counter is incrimented. If the counter is more than 1, the number is not considered as prime number.
Then the prime numbers are printed.

3.Find the missing number

Question: 
How to find the missing number in the given integer array of 1 to 100 without using any inbuilt functions

Working:
The program creats a function that takes an array as argument.The array is having integiors from 1 to 100 with one number missing.
Inside the function,a new array is created and the passed array is copied to it. Then the numbers inside the new array is added.
Then the sum of 1 to 100 is calculated using while loop. Both the sums are subtracted each other and the value is returned.
That value gives the missing number and is printed
